                    <h2> Our Goal</h2>
                    <p>We have 5 years before our youngest son, Hank, enters middle school.  In that time we hope to take him to visit all 50 states. This goal has been years in the making.  We have routes planned and alternative routes planned. We will travel by trailer, car, plane, and maybe cruise ship. We plan to see some sites, eat some burgers and pick up a rock in each state.</p>

                    <h2>Intro to our Family</h2>
                    <p>The Yancey family consists of two parents, three sons, two daughters, one daughter-in-law, one son-in-law, and one cat. Everyone is an adult except the youngest son, Hank.  He is six. We love this new dynamic of raising an “only child” and taking him on crazy fun adventures. Though the adult children are a little jealous.</p>
